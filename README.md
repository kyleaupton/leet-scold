# leet-scold

Welcome to leet-scold, the Discord bot that's here to make your life just a little bit more miserable. 

## What does it do?

Well, it's pretty simple. This bot will remind you, in the most sarcastic and borderline mean way possible, to do your daily LeetCode problem. Because who doesn't love being berated by a bot?

## Why?

Because we believe in the power of tough love. And also because we're a little bit evil. But mostly the tough love thing.

## Features

* Daily reminders to do your LeetCode problem
* A unique blend of sarcasm and condescension in every message
* The ability to make you question your life choices

## How to Use

1. Invite the bot to your server.
2. Wait for the berating to begin.
3. Question your life choices.
4. Do your LeetCode problem to make it stop.

## Disclaimer

This bot is a joke. Please don't take it seriously. If you do, we'll just laugh at you. And then remind you to do your LeetCode problem.

## Contributing
